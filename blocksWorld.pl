blocks([a, b, c, d, e, f]).

block(X):-
	block(BLOCKS),  % this extracts the list BLOCKS
	member(X, BLOCKS).

% move(X, Y, Z, S1, S2) holds when the state S2 is obtained
% from the state S1 by moving the block X from the block Y
% onto the block Z.
move(X, Y, Z, S1, S2):-
	member([clear, X], S1), %find a clear block X in S1
	member([on, X, Y], S1), block(Y), %find a block on which X sits
	member([clear, Z], S1), notequal(X, Z), %find another clear block, Z
	substitute([on, X, Y], [on, X, Z], S1, INT),  %remove X from Y, place it on Z
	substitute([clear, Z], [clear, Y], INT, S2). % Z is no longer clear; Y is now clear

% notequal(X1, X2) takes two arguments and holds true when these
% arguments are not equal.  In other words, it fails when the
% arguments are equal and otherwise succeeds.
notequal(X, X):-!, fail. % fail, if equal.
notequal(_, _).          % otherwise, succeed.

% substitute (E, E1, OLD, NEW) holds when NEW is the list OLD in which
% E is substituted by E1.  There are no duplicates in OLD or NEW.

% Here, the head X of [X|T] is substituted by Y to yield the
% list with the head Y to produce the list [Y|T].  The tails
% of OLD and NEW are the same, because we seek to substitute
% only one occurrence.
substitute(X, Y, [X|T], [Y|T]).  

% In this clause the element to be substituted is NOT the head of the
% list, so the head H of the list [H|T] carries over to the head H of
% the new list, but the tail of the new list is obtained from the tail
% T of the old list where the element X was substituted by Y, producing
% the new list [H|T1].
substitute(X, Y, [H|T], [H|T1]):- 
    substitute(X, Y, T, T1).  

% to do: write rules for: move block from block onto table, move block
% from table onto block

% there is a path from state S1 to state S2 when there is a move from S1 to S2.
path(S1, S2):-
	move(X, Y, Z, S1, S2).

% connect is the symmetric version of path: states S1 and S2 are connected if 
% there is a path from S1 to S2 or a path from S2 to S1.
connect(S1, S2) :- path(S1, S2).
connect(S1, S2) :- path(S2, S1).

% to do: define start and goal
% start(…).
% goal(…).

notYetVisited(State, PathSoFar):-
	permutation(State, PermuteState),
	notmember(PermuteState, PathSoFar).

% dfs(Start, Path, PathSoFar): returns the Path from the start to the goal state
% given the path so far.

% Trivial: if X is the goal return X as the path from X to X.
dfs(X, [X],_):- goal(X).

% else expand X by Y and find path from Y
dfs(X, [X|Ypath], VISITED):-
 	connect(X, Y),
  	negmember(Y, VISITED), % replace negmember by notYetVisited when using on the block world
  	dfs(Y, FILLIN, [Y|VISITED]).
